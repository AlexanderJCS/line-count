# Line Count
A library that counts the lines within a file, directory, or directory tree.

It can be run through the command line, or functions can be imported to be used in your own Python projects.

Some benefits of `linecount` over other libraries include:
- See the number of source lines of code (SLOC), commented lines, and blank lines
- Exclude files or directories whose names contain certain characters. This is useful for excluding files with certain file extensions, or certain directories like `venv` or `.git`.
- Only include files whose names contain certain characters. This is useful for counting lines of files with certain file extensions.

## Installing

You can install the project from the pypi test server:
```shell
$ pip install -i https://test.pypi.org/simple/ linecount
```
(this project is not on the main pypi yet, since account registration is closed for the main pypi server).
