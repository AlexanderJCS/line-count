This file should contain 5 source lines of code (SLOC).

    Here's a SLOC!

Here's one too!

here's a SLOC with an inline comment at the end  // :)
and another one!  # but with a hashtag inline comment

# Not a source line of code :(

// or this one :(

/* This is not a source line of code
 * or this
 */ this isn't a SLOC either

due to limitations with the inline comment algorithm, this is not a SLOC due to the opening-then-closing inline comment /* :) */
// however, maybe in the future, the above line will be considered a SLOC?
// definitely something to add to the to-do list, but not a large priority since you don't see the above scenario often
